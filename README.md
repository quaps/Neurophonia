# Neurophonia

Neurophonia is suite of concise audio programs influenced by the idea of 'Third Ear' music. Avant-garde composer Maryanne Amacher discovered & experimented with a form of music wherein the human listening apparatus becomes a "neurophonic instrument": both a receiver and producer of sound. Somewhere in the domain of the ear’s physiology and the brain’s interpretive perception, the new instrument was also conceived as a collaborator with the music: the sounds streaming out of the listeners head would mix with, and affect the electronically generated sound characters. 

This series of works began in 2004, with basic explorations of various aspects of auditory perception in Max/Msp & SuperCollider. Included (& required) is the SuperCollider synth file, (to be added wherever the user keeps their TidalCycles synths). The synths added are primarily primitives: basic Sine, Saw, Square, etc., & some of SC's chaos generators. In the future I hope to create more dynamic info for these SynthDefs.

Broken up into stylistic 'characters', Neurophonia uses the SuperCollider synthesis engine in tandem with the excellent TidalCycles mini-language for Haskell. It presents works in progress, mostly 1-liners that are mixed and matched on-the-fly. The live-coding phenomenon has greatly expanded the expressive capabilities of the computer musician who wishes to spontaneously conjure sonic characters. The composable live-programming technique emphasizes a functional approach, which in the domain of sound is best described as functions of time (Spiegel).

Also included in this repo is the 'geometrism' library: a library of patterns harvested from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Generally sequences taken from geometric objects or abstractions, these can be scaled and mapped as the user wishes. In the future I hope to distill this into an autonomous project.

NB: This is a work in progress, & far from complete. 
To Do:
- Fix the geometrism module path/loading
- Clean up directory organization
- Upload video & images of software in use
- More ...

Otozigguratz
Series exploring evoked otoacoustic emissions: sounds that are emitted from the inner ear. Influenced in style by the rapid, arpeggiated stepping patterns of Amacher's Synaptic Island.

The Second Order
Series exploring slightly detuned octaves that create second order beat frequencies. Stylistic emphasis on long form drone.

Impulsion
Simple implementation of granular synthesis.

Coiled Coils
Experiments with detuned timing patterns. E.g. the types of tuning one would find with beat frequencies, but applied to discreet temporal, rhythmic patterns.

CryptoSounds
Experiments with randomness.

CZ-SI
Utilizes mathermatical forms of caesium & silicon to create latticed sonic characters.
